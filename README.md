📌 Project Overview

This artifact showcases a custom AI chatbot created from TED-style presentation scripts written by multiple graduate students.
The chatbot can:

Answer questions about each speaker

Summarize their motivational message

Retrieve speakers by theme or topic

Provide personalized encouragement using each speaker’s story

The core dataset was built by extracting, cleaning, and structuring written presentation content into a JSON file.

🧠 What the Chatbot Can Do

✔ Retrieve information about any speaker

✔ Provide a motivational summary

✔ List speakers based on themes (growth, AI, leadership, courage, etc.)

✔ Respond to conversational queries using curated content

✔ Demonstrate how structured text powers simple rule-based AI

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

JSON for structured dataset storage

Rule-based retrieval logic (no ML model required)

Clean content preprocessing from student scripts

Console-based interactive chatbot

No external NLP libraries are required for this portfolio version.
