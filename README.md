## 📌 Project Overview  
This artifact showcases a custom AI chatbot created from TED-style presentation scripts written by multiple graduate students.  
The chatbot can:

- Answer questions about each speaker  
- Summarize their motivational message  
- Retrieve speakers by theme or topic  
- Provide personalized encouragement using each speaker’s story  

The core dataset was built by extracting, cleaning, and structuring written presentation content into a JSON file.

---

## 🧠 What the Chatbot Can Do
- ✔ Retrieve information about any speaker  
- ✔ Provide a motivational summary  
- ✔ List speakers based on themes (growth, AI, leadership, courage, etc.)  
- ✔ Respond to conversational queries using curated content  
- ✔ Demonstrate how structured text powers simple rule-based AI  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- JSON for structured dataset storage  
- Rule-based retrieval logic  
- Clean content preprocessing from student scripts  
- Console-based interactive chatbot  

_No external NLP libraries are required for this portfolio version._
